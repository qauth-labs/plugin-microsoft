# The end-to-end suite: QAuth's released server image with this plugin
# installed the way an operator installs it, against a mock of the Microsoft
# identity platform, driven over HTTP by e2e/microsoft.e2e.test.ts.
#
# Needs docker (with compose), openssl, node and pnpm. Run it from anywhere:
#
#   pnpm run e2e
#
# It packs the plugin as npm would receive it, makes throwaway secrets and a
# throwaway CA in e2e/.work/, builds the image (e2e/Dockerfile), starts the
# deployment (e2e/compose.yml), runs the suite and takes everything down.
# On a failure it prints the server's and the mock's logs.
